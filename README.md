rust implementation of [this](https://github.com/CanaanGM/help-me).
as am still not comfy with rust i couldn't go the full way but will work on it later.

### RUN
- put on good shoose and stretch
- create a `.env` file in the root dir; besides the `README` file
    - add inside it `APIKEY=YOURKEY`
    - refer to the up rep for steps to get one
- `cargo run`
